# Algoritham For Implementing Linear search .

1. Create Go file with name `linearsearch.go` You can name what you like but decriptive name is recomended.
2. Ones we creted file.
3. Now we have import require Packages.
4. Then start to write Actual code.
5. Lets Impliment the logic. 
6. As we Know the linear serach is works `Sequantialy`.
7. We Require an array which is must .
8. then we have to write function for sorting array, in this funcation we require target value.
9. Now we have pass the input.
10. stop
